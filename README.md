# Security-Lock
uses face recognition to unlock and lock a keyThe Face Recognition Lock System is a security project designed to unlock a door or device only when an authorized person’s face is detected. It combines computer vision and machine learning to provide a modern, contactless alternative to traditional locks. Using a live camera feed, the system captures a user’s face, compares it to pre-stored images, and triggers a lock mechanism if there’s a match. This project aims to demonstrate real-world applications of AI-powered biometric authentication for home or office security.
